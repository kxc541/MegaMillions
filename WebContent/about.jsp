             The OCD's Dash for Picking Mega Millions Numbers
So picking lottery numbers is a pretty trivial you would think. Well, wrong. It's not.
-Somebody with OCD...or anybody, really :)

LOGO GOES HERE

So you hear on the TV, Radio, Internet (Insert any other type of media here) and the Mega Millions jackpot if now a whopping $250 million dollars(It is right now as I'm typing this. Well, $253 million to be exact!). So this is when you start thinking in your head, maybe I should go grab a ticket at the gas station after work or whatever. Or if you're with friends you guys are probably ping ponging ideas off each other about what you guys would do with all that cash. 
You: I'd buy a house for my mom!
You friend: I'd get a one way ticket to Paris! Screw {Insert the city you live in here} !!!!
You: That's ridiculous. You need to come back here and get your ticket!
Your friend: Whatever. I'm paying going to pay off your student loans!
You: I love you.
We've all experienced this before in one form or another. So now you're all pumped to get out of work and spend your 1 dollar on a ticket that could very well make you a multimillionaire. On second thought, so many people are going to be buying tickets today and could pick your numbers or something ridiculous like that. So then you decide you better shove out an extra 4 bucks to get a few more tickets. It's all set. When you leave work, you're going to the nearest gas station and dishing out a cool 5 bucks for 5 tickets.
With all those happy and high thoughts about being comfortable for the rest of your life you shimmy along to that Shell, BP, or whatever gas station you go to and get your tickets. However, when you're there you've realized something. You have NO IDEA what your numbers are going to be.  You try to play your birthday. Let's say in this instance it's 08/19/82. So you have 3 numbers now. Actually, NO. The Mega Million rules state that you can  pick a number for your first five numbers between 1 and 75. The Mega Ball is only between 1 and 15. So cool, you can play 8 and 19. As for 82, chuck it. You probably wish you were born 5 years earlier(75). No? Ok. I'd rather be younger too. I was not born in '82 by the way.
